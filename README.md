# Easy-ArduinoNeuralNetwork
Artificial Neural Network for Arduino, tested in Arduino UNO, and MEGA.
[Neurona](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/neurona/) is an Arduino library which allows boards to feed Artificial Neural Network (ANN) structures in order to perform tasks such as pattern recognition (classification), non-linear regression, function approximation and time-series prediction from the [Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)](http://www.moretticb.com/blog/multilayer-perceptron-implementation-in-c/) architecture implementation.
