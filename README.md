# Easy-ArduinoNeuralNetwork
Artificial Neural Network for Arduino called **Neurona**, tested on Arduino UNO, and MEGA.
[Neurona](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/neurona/) is an Arduino library which allows boards to feed Artificial Neural Network (ANN) structures in order to perform tasks such as pattern recognition (classification), non-linear regression, function approximation and time-series prediction from the [Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)](http://www.moretticb.com/blog/multilayer-perceptron-implementation-in-c/) architecture implementation.

In this example, it is a 2-bit binary classification using Neurona library. It is easy and simple to do.

The following steps to implement Neural Networks on Arduino are
1.  Download the [Neurona](https://github.com/MorettiCB/Neurona) library and add it to your Arduino IDE.
2.  Go to [MLP Topology Workbench](http://www.moretticb.com/MTW/)
3.  Click **TRAINING** tab and input the dataset like this
